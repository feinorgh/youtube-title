# youtube-title
YouTube-Title - Extracts the title from a YouTube URL

For this to work, you need to get an API key from the Google Developer Console
https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/?hl=en_US#generatingdevkeys

Put the value of the key on a single line into a file called "api.key" in the
same directory as this script.

# Dependencies
This script requires the 'Google API Python Client' library. See
[https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/] for details.

On Gentoo, you can do
  emerge dev-python/google-api-python-client
